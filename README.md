Welcome To The Jungle is a mini e-commerce application built with Ruby on Rails 6.1, Active Record and Rspec for testing. Users can browse products, add to cart and checks-out strip payment system. If a user is an admin they are also able to add/remove items or create new categories using a admin dashboard.
